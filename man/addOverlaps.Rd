\title{Add overlaps between annotation gene sets}
\usage{
addOverlaps(study)
}
\arguments{
\item{study}{An OmicAnalyzer study created with \code{\link{createStudy}}}
}
\description{
The app's network view of the enrichments results requires pairwise overlap
metrics between all the terms of each annotation in order to draw the edges
between the nodes/terms. These overlaps are calculated automatically when
installing or exporting an OmicAnalyzer study. If you'd like, you can
manually calculate these pairwise overlaps by calling \code{addOverlaps}
prior to installing or exporting your study.
