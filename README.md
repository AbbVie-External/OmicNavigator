# OmicNavigator: Open-Source Software for Omic Data Analysis and Visualization

Exploring the results of omic analyses via interactive web applications
facilitates cross-disciplinary collaboration and biological discovery.
OmicNavigator is open-source software for the archival and interactive
exploration of results from high-throughput biology experiments. The software
enables omic data analysts (typically bioinformaticians) to create customizable
web applications from the results of their work using only the statistical
programming language, R. OmicNavigator is bundled as an R package that contains
web application code, R functions for programmatic access and data deposition,
and a new container for the storage of measurements (e.g. RNAseq read counts),
statistical analyses (differential expression and/or enrichment analysis),
metadata, and custom plotting functions. Studies created with OmicNavigator are
themselves R packages, accessible via a JavaScript dashboard that can be
interrogated on the userâ€™s local machine or deployed online to be explored by
collaborators. The dashboard combines user-defined study results and feature
plots with performant tables and interactive graphics common to bioinformatic
analyses such as scatter, network, volcano, and barcode plots. The tool also
includes dynamic, multi-set filtering across hypothesis tests based on
user-defined thresholds such as statistical significance or effect size.

## Download

Download the tarball from the GitHub Releases page. It will look
like `OmicNavigator_x.x.x.tar.gz`, where `x.x.x` corresponds to the version.

You need to download the tarball in order to run the app. If you clone the Git
repository, you will only obtain the R code without the app.

## Installation from the R console

1. Install dependencies:

    1) Full installation. This is required if you want to run the app from R.

        ```
        remotes::install_deps("OmicNavigator_x.x.x.tar.gz", dependencies = TRUE)
        ```

    1) Minimal installation. If you only need to create an OmicNavigator study,
       you can install many fewer dependencies.

        ```
        remotes::install_deps("OmicNavigator_x.x.x.tar.gz")
        ```

1. Install OmicNavigator:

    ```
    install.packages("OmicNavigator_x.x.x.tar.gz", repos = NULL)
    ```

## Installation from the terminal

1. Install dependencies:

    1) Full installation. This is required if you want to run the app from R.

        ```
        Rscript -e 'remotes::install_deps("OmicNavigator_x.x.x.tar.gz", dependencies = TRUE)'
        ```

    1) Minimal installation. If you only need to create an OmicNavigator study,
       you can install many fewer dependencies.

        ```
        Rscript -e 'remotes::install_deps("OmicNavigator_x.x.x.tar.gz")'
        ```

1. Install OmicNavigator:

    ```
    R CMD INSTALL --no-multiarch --with-keep.source OmicNavigator_x.x.x.tar.gz
    ```

## Installation troubleshooting

Some of the R package dependencies require external software libraries to
already be installed on your machine (e.g. the R package curl requires the
system library libcurl). Unfortunately R is unable to install these for you
automatically. If you are using Linux/macOS, you will need to install these
system libraries yourself first.

If you are using Debian/Ubuntu, you can install all of the required system
libraries using the commands below:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install \
  libcurl4-openssl-dev \
  libssl-dev \
  libprotobuf-dev \
  protobuf-compiler \
  libxml2-dev
```

Here is a table of the known system dependencies that you will need to install.
